## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Hi, i'm Lorenzo aka reloonfire (19 y.o) and i'm currently a CS student @UniMib.
Game enthusiast and aspiring game developer.


### Current Projects
ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on 2 main projects: NoNameGame and [ROFLang](https://github.com/reloonfire/rof-language)
### About that
  - ROF is a an interpreted, dynamically-typed and simple language, developed in order to practice with different languages (i have tried to implement a version in C++ and GoLang). (Like the README says)
   - NoNameGame is a game (as the name implies), but it is a private project so shhh
   
ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Golang, Java, PHP and C++
